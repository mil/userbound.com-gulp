The SIIG MiniTouch is a 75% mechnical keyboard produced circa 1991. At the time of manufacture, the MiniTouch was outfitted with either [clicky white alps]() switches or [montery blue alps]() switches.

Admiring the form factor and mechanical nature of the, Minitouch I decided to pick one up for $30-some bills on eBay. My problem with the Minitouch is that the one I picked up featured the clicky white alps which made more noise than any keyboard I'd ever owned. Louder than a Model M, I wanted to silence my Minitouch.

Luckily in my closet was a Apple Extended II keyboard featuring cream alps.
