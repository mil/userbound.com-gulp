There are likely thousands of TODO list "applications" and "systems" out there, however, I think we've forgotten the most simple and elegent solution:

In your **.bashrc** or **.zshrc**:

<pre class="sh_c">
cat &tilde;/.TODO
</pre>

Then just maintain a file in your home directory called **.TODO** with all the things you need to do. 

Every time you launch a new shell you'll be reminded of what you need to do. Do you really need another piece of software to "manage" your TODO list?
