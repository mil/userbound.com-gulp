[Autojump](http://github.com/joelthelion/autojump) is an ingenious piece of software that maintains a database of the most frequent directories you use from command line. Then you can simply jump to those directories by short hand. For example, I frequently vist the directory */home/mil/code/repos/github/foo-wm*. Typing this out with *cd* every time I launch a new terminal would normally either require: the combination of me hitting the first few letters with a lot of tabs or a backwards search with control-r. However autojump is far simpler:

<pre class="sh_c">
j github/foo
</pre>

It's that easy and it works damn well. If I ever find myself repetitively hitting tab, I stop and figure out where I'm going and go there with *j*. Thank you [joelthelion](http://github.com/joelthelion) for a piece of true quality software.
