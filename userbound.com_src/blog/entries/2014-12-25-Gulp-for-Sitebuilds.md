Over time my site has morphed far from being a simple blog. Jekyll provides some powerful features, especially [collections](), howvever I've outgrown the semantics all together. As such, I've converted this site from Jekyll to Gulp.

In my ideal world, a static site compiler should just be a script or a very simple set of rules transforming some assets into others. I intermittedly [built the roots of my own semantic]() and then read up on this things called [Gulp]().

The reason I like Gulp is because it's really god damn simple. It's usable at it's bare minimum just using `gulp.src()` and `gulp.dest()`
