<h2>My First Mixtape: Bufferbank</h2>
<p>Over the past few months I've been working on putting together a small mixtape of lofi shorts. Entitled <a href="https://bufferbank.bandcamp.com">Bufferbank</a>, my first mixtape is finally available for <a href="https://bufferbank.bandcamp.com">download</a>. It's 15 tracks - about 10 minutes running time.</p>
<p>It's quite lofi and there's lots of static throughout, but if you can get around that -- I believe it gets its message through. Take it how you will and if you like what I've done I'd love to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:miles%20at%20userbound%20dot%20com">hear from you</a>.</p>
