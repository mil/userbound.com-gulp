## Overview 
Asciiw is a little weather site I made using the [wunderground api]() which show the basic weather status for your location along with some nice handcrafted ASCII animations. 

<div class='captioned-image'>
<img src="test">
<span class='caption'>osidjf sdf sdf sdf</span>
</div>

## Technical Details
Each animation is custom drawn in ASCII.

The zipcode the site uses is dermined based on the URL. For example if you want to see the weather in New Jersey, visit [http://asciiw.com/]().
