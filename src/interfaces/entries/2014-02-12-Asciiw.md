This was a little weather site I made using the [wunderground api]() which show the basic weather status for your location along with some nice handcrafted ASCII animations. 

<div class='captioned-image'>
<img src="test">
<span class='caption'>osidjf sdf sdf sdf</span>
</div>

The zipcode the site uses is dermined based on the URL. For example if you want to see the weather in New Jersey, visit [http://asciiw.com/]().
