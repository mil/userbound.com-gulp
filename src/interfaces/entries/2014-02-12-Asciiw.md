Asciiw is a little weather site I made using the [wunderground api]() which show the basic weather status for your location along with some nice handcrafted ASCII animations. 


<div class='interface-hero'>
<div class='window-chrome'><img src="/interfaces/Asciiw/screenshot.png"></div>
<span class='caption'></span>
</div>

Each animation is custom drawn in ASCII and cycled through with javascript. For example, here's the animation for rain! Which I don't see a lot of in Austin these days :(

<script src="/interfaces/Asciiw/site/js/frames.js"></script>
<pre class='ascii-frames'>
               ,--.,            
      ,--,--. (     ),   ,--.,  
     (       (,___,__)  (     ),
    (,___,____,)       (,___,__)
                 |              
      |                   |     
            |                   
                |      |        
          |                     
                                
             |      |           
</pre>

By default [asciiw.com]() uses my zip code in Austin, Texas but can be switched to any zip code adding `/zipcode` to the URL. 

For example, to get the weather for Blacksburg, Virginia zipcode 24060 simply visit [asciiw.com/24060](http://asciiw.com/24060).
