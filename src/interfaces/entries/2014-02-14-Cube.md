During the summer of my junior year at Virginia Tech, I stayed in Blacksburg and did the summer-session for Industrial Design minors. It was a relaxing, thoughtful, and productive summer. I learned to sketch perspective and developed an interest in [3d modeling](http://www.openscad.org/).

For our final project in the summer-session, I built a small portable speaker box dubbed the Cube.

I modeled The entire cube in `openscad` and combined the surfaces as dxf files `import`'ed into a modular master `openscad` composition. 

Eventually when I was satisfied I cut the dxf layers out of masonite on our laser cutter. The final cube was assembled with wood glue.
