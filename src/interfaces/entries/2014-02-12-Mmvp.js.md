Mmvp.js is micro-MVP javascript library which allows you to bind presenter callbacks to be triggered in reaction to changes in a model. 

Here's the archetypal TodoMvC coded up using `Mmvp`'s presenter callbacks:

<div class='interface-demo'>
<script type='text/javascript' src='/interfaces/Mmvp.js/demo/underscore.min.js'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='/interfaces/Mmvp.js/demo/Mmvp.js'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='/interfaces/Mmvp.js/demo/js/todo.js'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='/interfaces/Mmvp.js/demo/js/demo_page.js'></script>
<link rel='stylesheet' href='/interfaces/Mmvp.js/demo/css/style.css' />

<section id="demo" class='block'>
  <nav><h3 class='view active'>View</h3><h3 class='model'>Model</h3></nav>
  <section id='switcher'> 
    <section class='view active'>  
      <div id="viewpen"></div>
      <div id='newitem'>
        <span class='hint'>&raquo;</span>
        <input type='text' placeholder='Item Name'>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class='model'><pre class='brush: js; toolbar: false;'></pre></section>
  </section>
</section>

</div>



Binding callbacks is as simple as passing the given callback function to a `Mmvp`'s `set_action`.  Once an action is bound, modifying the model dispatches any attached callbacks:

<pre class='sh_javascript'>
var presenter = new Mmvp();
var model = {};

presenter.set_action({
    add: function(key, value) {
        console.log(
            "key '" + key + "' added with value '" + value + "'"
        );
    }
});

model.item_a = "hello";
presenter.sync(model);
// console.log: key 'item_a' added with value 'hello'</pre>
</pre>

The following actions may be specified for models changes:

|Action     |Arguments         | Dispatched when |
|:-------   |:-----------------|:-----------------------------------------|
|`add`      | `key`, `value`   | An item is added to the model               |
|`remove`   | `key`,           | An item is removed from the model           |
|`update`   | `key`, `value`   | An item's value was udpated                 |
|`populate` | `key`, `value`   | The model goes from being empty to populated |
|`empty`    |                  | The model goes from being populated to empty  |



You can imagine how you more complex views might be constructed with Jquery in combination with your favorite templating language in the action callbacks to create robust presenter logic using `Mmvp`. 

The overall preminition when using `Mmvp.js`, is that that you should construct M-&gt;V callbacks and not V-&gt;M callbacks. After all V-&gt;M archiceture is typically dispatched through user-interface callbacks.
