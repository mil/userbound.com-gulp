Mmvp.js is micro-MVP javascript library for composing web-based UIs in which all DOM manipulation, templating, and animation logic lives in several presenter callbacks which are excuted when your model is modified.  

Consider the following code snippet:

<pre class='sh_javascript'>
var presenter = new Mmvp();
var model = {};

presenter.set_action({
    add: function(key, value) {
        console.log(
            "key '" + key + "' added with value '" + value + "'"
        );
    }
});

model.item_a = "hello";
presenter.sync(model);
</pre>


In the above example, the `add` callback is dispatched when a new items is added to the model model causing the console to display:

<pre class='sh_javascript'>key 'item_a' added with value 'hello'</pre>

You can imagine how you might work with Jquery or your favorite templtaing language in the action callbacks to create robust presenter logic using Mmvp. 

Other than the `add` action, a number of other actions may be specified using `Mmvp.set_action()` including:


|Action     |Arguments         |Called when |
|:-------   |:-----------------|:-----------------------------------------|
|`add`      | `key`, `value`   | Item is added to the model               |
|`remove`   | `key`,           | Item is removed from the model           |
|`update`   | `key`, `value`   | Item's value was udpated                 |
|`populate` | `key`, `value`   | Model goes from being empty to populated |
|`empty`    |                  | Mode goes from being populated to empty  |

Finally, a MvP library explication wouldn't be complete without a Todo demo. So here's the archetypal TodoMvc demo which binds all available actions using `Mmvp.set_action`. 


<div class='interface-hero'>
<script type='text/javascript' src='/interfaces/Mmvp.js/demo/underscore.min.js'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='/interfaces/Mmvp.js/demo/Mmvp.js'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='/interfaces/Mmvp.js/demo/js/todo.js'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='/interfaces/Mmvp.js/demo/js/demo_page.js'></script>
<link rel='stylesheet' href='/interfaces/Mmvp.js/demo/css/style.css' />

<section id="demo" class='block'>
  <nav><h3 class='view active'>View</h3><h3 class='model'>Model</h3></nav>
  <section id='switcher'> 
    <section class='view active'>  
      <div id="viewpen"></div>
      <div id='newitem'>
        <span class='hint'>&raquo;</span>
        <input type='text' placeholder='Item Name'>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class='model'><pre class='brush: js; toolbar: false;'></pre></section>
  </section>
</section>

</div>


Take note that the demo code [controller logic]() specifying the presenter and ui callbacks (76SLOC) is only slightly heavier than the [Mmvp.js]() library itself (56SLOC) here!
