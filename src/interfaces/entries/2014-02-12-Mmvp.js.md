Mmvp.js is a micro-MVP library which understands the view as ephemeral… exclusively conceived &amp; manipulated through callbacks.  Accordingly, all your DOM manipulation, templating, &amp; animation logic lives in several presenter callbacks (<code>empty</code>, <code>populate</code>, <code>add</code>, <code>remove</code>, &amp; <code>update</code>).

When the model is modified, the corresponding presenter callback(s) are triggered. Mmvp.js believes M→V architecture itself should be completely decoupled from the DOM.  Infact, Mmv(P).js, on its own, does not even know the DOM exists.  Put simply, Mmvp.js is just P framework to bind V-generating callbacks to model changes.
