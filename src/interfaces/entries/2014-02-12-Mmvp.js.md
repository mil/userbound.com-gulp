Mmvp.js is micro-MVP javascript library for composing web-based UIs in which all DOM manipulation, templating, &amp; animation logic lives in several presenter callbacks.


The core of `Mmvp.js` centered around the idea of..  Each time a new model is passed to `presenter.sync`, between the new model and the last model passed into sync. Depending on the diff, the correct corresponding  presenter callbacks are excuted.

<pre class='sh_javascript'>
var presenter = new Mmvp();
var model = {};

presenter.set_action({
    add: function(key, value) {
        console.log("key", key, "added with value", value);
    }
});

model.item_a = "hello";
presenter.sync(model);
</pre>


Callbacks are set using `Mmvp.set_action` as seen above. The Bindable callbacks are:

|Key        |Arguments         |Called when |
|:-------   |:-----------------|:-----------------------------------------|
|`add`      | `key`, `value`   | Item is added to the model               |
|`remove`   | `key`,           | Item is removed from the model           |
|`update`   | `key`, `value`   | Item's value was udpated                 |
|`populate` | `key`, `value`   | Model goes from being empty to populated |
|`empty`    |                  | Mode goes from being populated to empty  |


The following Todo MVC demo, [controller logic]() is only slightly heavier than the [Mmvp library]() itself.
