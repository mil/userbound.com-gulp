## Overview
Mmvp.js is micro-MVP javascript library for composing web-based UIs in which all DOM manipulation, templating, &amp; animation logic lives in several presenter callbacks.  Consider the following example:

<pre class='sh_javascript'>
var presenter = new Mmvp();
var model = {};

presenter.set_action({
    add: function(key, value) {
        console.log("key", key, "added with value", value);
    }
});

model.item_a = "hello";
presenter.sync(model);
</pre>

Each time a new model is passed to the `presenter.sync`, a diff is compared between the new model and the last model passed into sync. Depending on the diff, the correct corresponding  presenter callbacks are excuted. 


## Demo
So here's the archetypal Todo MVC demo. The controller logic is only slightly heavier than the Mmvp library itself.


<script type='text/javascript' src='/interfaces/Mmvp.js/demo/underscore.min.js'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='/interfaces/Mmvp.js/demo/Mmvp.js'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='/interfaces/Mmvp.js/demo/js/todo.js'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='/interfaces/Mmvp.js/demo/js/demo_page.js'></script>
<link rel='stylesheet' href='/interfaces/Mmvp.js/demo/css/style.css' />

<section id="demo" class='block'>
  <nav><h3 class='view active'>View</h3><h3 class='model'>Model</h3></nav>
  <section id='switcher'> 
    <section class='view active'>  
      <div id="viewpen"></div>
      <div id='newitem'>
        <span class='hint'>&raquo;</span>
        <input type='text' placeholder='Item Name'>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class='model'><pre class='brush: js; toolbar: false;'></pre></section>
  </section>
</section>



## Events API
Callbacks are set using `Mmvp.set_action` as seen above. The Bindable callbacks are:

|Key        |Arguments         |Called when |
|:-------   |:-----------------|:-----------------------------------------|
|`add`      | `key`, `value`   | Item is added to the model               |
|`remove`   | `key`,           | Item is removed from the model           |
|`update`   | `key`, `value`   | Item's value was udpated                 |
|`populate` | `key`, `value`   | Model goes from being empty to populated |
|`empty`    |                  | Mode goes from being populated to empty  |

## Final Thoughts
I created Mmvp after failing in my search to find a minimal micro-MVP architecture. In my mind, the architecture itself shouldn't have to be used in combination with the DOM at all. Infact one could construct a MVP interace with Mmvp.js that is not.

Below is the archetypal TodoMVC demo using Mmvp.js. The [demo code]() weighs in around 78 SLOC, the [framework itself]() is 46 SLOC.
