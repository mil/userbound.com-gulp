Mustache.io is a port of mustache into the Io language. I got intruiged with the [Io](http://iolanguage.org/) language and after finding _why's [yown](https://github.com/whymirror/yown), I became intruiged with the idea of making a web-based architecture in Io.

Unfortunatly, there seemed to be a serious lack of templating libraries for Io. And thus Mustach.io was born.


Mustache.io is designed to work both Io object and maps. It's simple api gives you two methods: `render` and `setDelimiters`:

|Method      |Arguments   |Description  |
|:------------|:------------|:-------------|
|`render` | `template`, `object`, `partials` | Renders the given template with the provided object and partials. |
|`setDelimiters` | `start_delimiter`, `end_delimiter` |  Sets the delimiters. |


For standard `Mustache` template rendering, a simple contrived example in `Io` might look like:

<pre class='sh_c'>
obj := Object clone do(
  name := "Miles"
  age  := 20 
)

template := "I am {{ name }}, age: {{ age }}"
Mustashe render(template, obj)
</pre>

yields:

<pre class='sh_c'>
I am Miles, age: 20
</pre>

That's pretty much all there is to it. Feel free to check out the [full documentation here](http://github.com/mil/mustache.io).
