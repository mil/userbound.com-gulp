## Overview
Mustache.io is a port of mustache into the Io language. I got intruiged with the [Io]() language and after finding _why's [yown](https://github.com/whymirror/yown), I became intruiged with the idea of making some web-based tools with Io. Unfortunatly, there seemed to be a serious lack of templating libraries for Io. And thus Mustach.io was born.  

The most contrived example is simple variable substitution e.g.:

<pre class='sh_c'>
obj := Object clone do(
  name := "Miles"
  age  := 20 
)

template := "I am {{ name }}, age: {{ age }}"
Mustashe render(template, obj)
</pre>

yields:

<pre class='sh_c'>
I am Miles, age: 20
</pre>


## API
Mustache.io is designed to work with both Io object and maps.
