## Overview
Mustache.io is a port of mustache into the Io language. I got intruiged with the [Io]() language and after finding _why's [yown](https://github.com/whymirror/yown), I became intruiged with the idea of making some web-based tools with Io. Unfortunatly, there seemed to be a serious lack of templating libraries for Io. And thus Mustach.io was born.

## API
Mustache.io is designed to work with both Io object and maps.
