## Overview
Foo-WM was an idealistic, minimalistc wm for X11 I built during the course of a summer whilist doing [Hacker School]().  The premise of `foo-wm` was my dream of wm to visually organize windows within a tree structure; furthermore this tree would be soley controllable via a IPC DSL.

Zooming through the window tree, you copious amounts of typical wm functionality could be ommited in favor of being emulatable through the DSL...  Need keybindings? That's not part of the WM, just use <code>xbindkeys</code> hooked up to the Foo DSL. Fullscreen a window, that's not part of the wm, it's just a <code>zoom +999</code>. Workspaces? that a `zoom -999` and you see all your windows. Want discrete workspaces, just <code>mark</code> and <code>jump</code>. You get the idea.

## The Foo DSL
The Foo DSL was the small set of commands I defined for interacting with Foo-Wm. All commands in the Foo DSL operatated on pointers nodes pointers in the tree - the <code>active node</code> and <code>view node</code>.

<span class='caption'>Workspace's didn't exist within `foo-wm`, because given the tree structure they were easily emulated using the `zoom` command.</span>
</div>

|Command   |Targets Node | Purpose |
|:---------|:------------|:--------|
|zoom      | `view node` | Zooms screen through tree |
|containerize | `focus node` | Wraps current node in a new parent node. |
|focus | `focus node` | Moves focus pointer to brother in focus node's parent. |
|shift | `focus node` | Moves focus node's parent/position in parent |
| kill | `focus node` | Removes focus node window from tree |
| zoom | `view node` | Changes pointer of view node, approximating current view node. |
| mark | `view node` | Sets a bookmark of current viewnode.. |
| jump | `view node` | Restors bookmark of viewnode set with `mark` |



The <code>active node</code> controlled the node currently throughputting mouse and keybaord events; which was capable of being changed, moved, reparented, and killed with the <code>focus</code>, <code>shift</code>, <code>containerize</code>, and <code>kill</code> commands.  While the <code>view node</code> represented the node that screen currently was dsiplaying which could be set, bookmarked, and jumped backed to through the <code>zoom</code>, <code>mark</code>, and <code>jump</code> commands respectivly.


## The Downfall of My Idealism
Atlast, I used past tense in this article beacuse yes, I no longer use Foo-WM. After building `foo-wm` I used it for about a year on and off. It _was_ my first serious C project and I learned to properly `malloc`, `free`, and `memset` the hard way; by watching everything crash and burn. Eventually, stability-wise it became quite usable being very capable of being used for numerous consecutive days in a row (admittedly though I never dug in with `valgrind`).

The true downfall of `foo-wm` was my laziness in implementing ICCM & EWMH hints. As a result, using `surf` and `urxvt` sessions would work flawlessly, but if you were to start launching applications that make extensive use of hinting (e.g. `gimp`, or real pagers -- not [`bar`]()) in foo wm and you could be in for a ride.

Now adays in terms of wm's I'm i3 until I start ramping up ideas of making my own wm again in which case I'd take a completly different approach to a meta-wm <sup>1</sup>.

While Foo Wm may be dead, it turns out it's s spirit lives on in some form. Bastein stated on the [herbluftwm mailing list]() that he took the skeleton of `foo-wm`' server client structure when he began his architecutre of [bspwm]() which is widely used in the Arch community. The code no longer resembles anything of Foo-wm, but I'm glad it's spirit lives on in some form.
