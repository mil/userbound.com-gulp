    - "Bastein stated on the <a href='http://sourceforge.net/p/herbstluftwm/mailman/message/29873505/'>herbluftwm mailing list</a> that Bspwm's server/client skeleton was originally extracted from <code>foo-wm</code>. Although, the code has evolved much since then, it's nice to know <code>foo-wm</code> helped out to an extent!"

Foo Wm was an idealistic, minimalistic wm for X11 I built during the course of a summer whilst doing [Hacker School](http://hackerschool.com).  The premise: a meta-wm-esque domain specific language for manipulating a flexible window tree.

Much typical WM functionality is purposefully omitted from the WM and emulated through the provided DSL.  Keybindings are not included, as you can use `xbindkeys` hooked up to the DSL.  Fullscreening a window is not part of the WM because that's just a <code>zoom +999</code> command. Workspaces? That's a `zoom -999` and you'll see all your windows, `containerize` and `zoom` around as needed. Want discrete workspaces, just <code>mark</code> and <code>jump</code>. You get the idea.

The Foo DSL controls everything with in `foo-wm`. All commands in the Foo DSL operate on two pointer nodes within the tree - the <code>active node</code> and <code>view node</code>.  

While the <code>active node</code> controls the node currently throughputting mouse and keybaord events; the <code>view node</code> represents the node that screen currently displaying. Here's the full DSL:



|Command   |Targets Node | Purpose |
|:---------|:------------|:--------|
|zoom      | `view node` | Zooms screen through tree |
|containerize | `focus node` | Wraps current node in a new parent node. |
|focus | `focus node` | Moves focus pointer to brother in focus node's parent. |
|shift | `focus node` | Moves focus node's parent/position in parent |
| kill | `focus node` | Removes focus node window from tree |
| zoom | `view node` | Changes pointer of view node, approximating current view node. |
| mark | `view node` | Sets a bookmark of current viewnode.. |
| jump | `view node` | Restors bookmark of viewnode set with `mark` |

After building `foo-wm` I used it for about a year on and off. Being my first major serious C project; I learned to about `malloc`, `free`, and `memset` the hard way while watching my windows crash and burn.  I've since stopped using `foo-wm` because I was too lazy to implement full [EWMH](http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-latest.html) window hinting.

When I go to build my next wm I'd likely scrap `foo-wm` and take a completely different approach<sup>1</sup> to a meta-wm altogether.

While Foo Wm may be dead, it spirit lives on in some form. The `0.1` release of [Bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm), a popular tree-based wm within the Arch community, was based around the server/client architecture that I built into `foo-wm`<sup>2</sup>.
