## Overview
Foo-WM was an idealistic, minimalist wm for X11 I built during the course of a summer whilist doing [Hacker School]().  The premise was that I dreamt of having a WM that did only two things:

1. Provide a tree structure for organizing windows.
2. Open some IPC for traversing and manipulating the tree.

The reason I wanted everything in Foo-WM ran through IPC soley controling a window tree was that is let me deliberatly ommit a large amount of typical wm functionality in the vein that seperate tools could be used to build that functionality in your desired scripting lanaguge.

Keybindings? You don't need those, just use <code>xbindkeys</code> hooked up to the Foo DSL. Fullscreen a window, that's just a <code>zoom +999</code>. Workspaces? Zoom out and you see everything, want discrete workspaces, just <code>mark</code> and <code>jump</code>.

## The Foo DSL
The Foo DSL was the small set of commands I defined for interacting with Foo-Wm. All commands in the Foo DSL operatated on pointers nodes pointers in the tree - the <code>active node</code> and <code>view node</code>.

The <code>active node</code> controlled the node currently throughputting mouse and keybaord events; which was capable of being changed, moved, reparented, and killed with the <code>focus</code>, <code>shift</code>, <code>containerize</code>, and <code>kill</code> commands.  

While the <code>view node</code> represented the node that screen currently was dsiplaying which could be set, bookmarked, and jumped backed to through the <code>zoom</code>, <code>mark</code>, and <code>jump</code> commands respectivly.


## The Downfall of My Idealism
I used past tense in this article beacuse yes, I no longer use Foo-WM. For a while I used it daily, but at the end of the day, it was an experiment. 

Foo Wm may be dead, but I think it's spirit lives on. Bastein stated on the [herbluftwm mailing list]() that he took the skeleton of foo-wm' server client structure when he began his architecutre of [bspwm]() which is widely used in the Arch community. The code no longer resembles anything of Foo-wm, but I'm glad it's spirit lives on in some form.
