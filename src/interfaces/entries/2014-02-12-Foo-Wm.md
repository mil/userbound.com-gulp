## Overview
Foo-WM was an idealistic, minimalist wm for X11 I built during the course of a summer whilist doing [Hacker School]().  The premise was that I wanted a WM that did only two things:

1. Provide a tree structure for organizing windows.
2. Open some IPC for traversing and manipulating the tree.

</div>

Since everything in Foo-WM ran through IPC, and the IPC soely controlled access to the tree, a lot of typical WM functionality I deliberatly ommited in vein that seperate tools could be used to build that functionality in your desired scripting lanaguge.

Keybindings? You don't need those, just use <code>xbindkeys</code> hooked up to the Foo DSL. Fullscreen a window, that's just a <code>zoom +999</code>. Workspaces? Zoom out and you see everything, want discrete workspaces, just <code>mark</code> and <code>jump</code>.

## The Foo DSL
The Foo DSL was the small set of commands I defined for interacting with Foo-Wm. All commands in the Foo DSL operatated on pointers nodes pointers in the tree - the <code>active node</code> and <code>view node</code>.

The <code>active node</code> controlled the node currently throughputting mouse and keybaord events; which was capable of being changed, moved, reparented, and killed with the <code>focus</code>, <code>shift</code>, <code>containerize</code>, and <code>kill</code> commands.  

While the <code>view node</code> represented the node that screen currently was dsiplaying which could be set, bookmarked, and jumped backed to through the <code>zoom</code>, <code>mark</code>, and <code>jump</code> commands respectivly.


## The Downfall of My Idealism
I used past tense in this article beacuse yes, I no longer use Foo-WM. For a while I used it daily, but at the end of the day, it was an experiment. 

Foo Wm may be dead, but I think it's spirit lives on. Bastein stated on the [herbluftwm mailing list]() that he took the skeleton of foo-wm' server client structure when he began his architecutre of [bspwm]() which is widely used in the Arch community. The code no longer resembles anything of Foo-wm, but I'm glad it's spirit lives on in some form.
