## Overview
Foo-WM was an idealistic, minimalist wm for X11 I built during the course of a summer whilist doing [Hacker School]().  The premise was that I dreamt of having a WM that did only two things:

1. Provide a tree structure for organizing windows.
2. Open some IPC for traversing and manipulating the tree.

</div>

Making my wm soley controll a (visual) window tree let me deliberatly ommit large amounts of typical wm functionality from foo wm in the vein that seperate tools could be used to build functionality in via your favorite scripting lanaguge.

Keybindings? You don't need those, just use <code>xbindkeys</code> hooked up to the Foo DSL. Fullscreen a window, that's just a <code>zoom +999</code>. Workspaces? Zoom out and you see everything, want discrete workspaces, just <code>mark</code> and <code>jump</code>.

## The Foo DSL
The Foo DSL was the small set of commands I defined for interacting with Foo-Wm. All commands in the Foo DSL operatated on pointers nodes pointers in the tree - the <code>active node</code> and <code>view node</code>.

</div>

The <code>active node</code> controlled the node currently throughputting mouse and keybaord events; which was capable of being changed, moved, reparented, and killed with the <code>focus</code>, <code>shift</code>, <code>containerize</code>, and <code>kill</code> commands.  

While the <code>view node</code> represented the node that screen currently was dsiplaying which could be set, bookmarked, and jumped backed to through the <code>zoom</code>, <code>mark</code>, and <code>jump</code> commands respectivly.


## The Downfall of My Idealism
Atlast, I used past tense in this article beacuse yes, I no longer use Foo-WM. After building `foo-wm` I used it for about a year on and off. It _was_ my first serious C project and I learned to properly `malloc`, `free`, and `memset` the hard way; by watching everything crash and burn. Eventually, stability-wise it became quite usable being very capable of being used for numerous consecutive days in a row (admittedly though I never dug in with `valgrind`).

The true downfall of `foo-wm` was my laziness in implementing ICCM & EWMH hints. As a result, using `surf` and `urxvt` sessions would work flawlessly, but if you were to start launching applications that make extensive use of hinting (e.g. `gimp`, or real pagers -- not [`bar`]()) in foo wm and you could be in for a ride.

Now adays in terms of wm's I'm i3 until I start ramping up ideas of making my own wm again in which case I'd take a completly different approach to a meta-wm <sup>1</sup>.

While Foo Wm may be dead, it turns out it's s spirit lives on in some form. Bastein stated on the [herbluftwm mailing list]() that he took the skeleton of `foo-wm`' server client structure when he began his architecutre of [bspwm]() which is widely used in the Arch community. The code no longer resembles anything of Foo-wm, but I'm glad it's spirit lives on in some form.
