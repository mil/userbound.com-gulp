An idealistic, minimalistc wm for X11 I built during the course of a summer whilist doing [Hacker School]().  The premise: a meta-wm-esque domain specific language for manipulating a flexible window tree.

Keybindings? not part the WM<sup>1</sup>.  use <code>xbindkeys</code> hooked up to the Foo DSL. Fullscreening a window, that's not part of the wm, it's just a <code>zoom +999</code> command. Workspaces? That a `zoom -999` and you'll see all your windows. Want discrete workspaces, just <code>mark</code> and <code>jump</code>. You get the idea.

The Foo DSL controls everything with in `foo-wm`. All commands in the Foo DSL operatated on two pointers nodes within the tree - the <code>active node</code> and <code>view node</code>.  While the <code>active node</code> controlled the node currently throughputting mouse and keybaord events; which was capable of being changed, moved, reparented, and killed. While the <code>view node</code> represented the node that screen currently was dsiplaying which could be set, bookmarked, and jumped backed to.

|Command   |Targets Node | Purpose |
|:---------|:------------|:--------|
|zoom      | `view node` | Zooms screen through tree |
|containerize | `focus node` | Wraps current node in a new parent node. |
|focus | `focus node` | Moves focus pointer to brother in focus node's parent. |
|shift | `focus node` | Moves focus node's parent/position in parent |
| kill | `focus node` | Removes focus node window from tree |
| zoom | `view node` | Changes pointer of view node, approximating current view node. |
| mark | `view node` | Sets a bookmark of current viewnode.. |
| jump | `view node` | Restors bookmark of viewnode set with `mark` |

Unfortunatly after defining the IPC, 



While building `foo-wm` I used it for about a year on and off. Being my first major serious C project; I learned to about `malloc`, `free`, and `memset` while building; watching my windows crash and burn. Stability-wise it eventually became usable.  The true downfall of `foo-wm` howeverwas my laziness in implementing ICCM & EWMH hints. As a result, using `surf` and `urxvt` sessions would work flawlessly, but if you were to start launching applications that make extensive use of hinting (e.g. `gimp`, or real pagers -- not [`bar`]()) in foo wm and you could be in for a ride.

Now adays in terms of wm's I'm i3 until I start ramping up ideas of making my own wm again in which case I'd take a completly different approach to a meta-wm <sup>1</sup>.

While Foo Wm may be dead, it turns out it's s spirit lives on in some form. Bastein stated on the [herbluftwm mailing list]() that he took the skeleton of `foo-wm`' server client structure when he began his architecutre of [bspwm]() which is widely used in the Arch community. The code no longer resembles anything of Foo-wm, but I'm glad it's spirit lives on in some form.

<li>Just use `xbindkeys`.</li>
<li>[no-wm]()'s orthangonlaity is an amazing proof-of-concept.</li>
