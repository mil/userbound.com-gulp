Foo Wm was an idealistic &amp; minimalistic wm for X11 which I built over the course of a summer while doing [Hacker School](http://hackerschool.com).  The architecture of the wm was simple, involving only two components:

- A tree data structure to hold windows **and**
- A DSL to manipulate &amp; traverse the window tree

In `foo-wm` 'tiling' and 'floating' modals of organization familiar in WIMP were just setting values of containers.  'Workspaces' were just the immediate containers of the root node.  And 'full-screening' a window meant simply issuing a `zoom` DSL command with a high positive delta.

The [Foo DSL](https://github.com/mil/foo-wm/blob/master/FOO-DSL.md), accessible via a socket, was the only way to interact with `foo-wm` itself. In fact, `foo-wm` didn't even provide a way to bind keys to wm actions, because [xbindkeys](https://github.com/mil/foo-wm/blob/master/config/.xbindkeysrc) could and still can do that anyway.

All commands in the [Foo DSL](https://github.com/mil/foo-wm/blob/master/FOO-DSL.md) operated on two pointer nodes within the tree. The <code>active node</code> controlled the node currently through-putting mouse and keyboard events; and the <code>view node</code> represented the node that the screen was currently displaying. The [full DSL](https://github.com/mil/foo-wm/blob/master/FOO-DSL.md) was as follows:



|Command   |Targets Node | Purpose |
|:---------|:------------|:--------|
|zoom      | `view node` | Zooms screen through tree. |
|containerize | `focus node` | Wraps current node in a new parent node. |
|focus | `focus node` | Moves focus pointer to brother in focus node's parent. |
|shift | `focus node` | Moves focus node's parent position relative to its parent. |
| kill | `focus node` | Removes focus node window from tree. |
| zoom | `view node` | Changes pointer of view node approximating current view node. |
| mark | `view node` | Sets a bookmark on the current viewnode. |
| jump | `view node` | Restores a bookmark of viewnode set with `mark`. |

After building `foo-wm` I used it for about a year on and off. Being my first major serious C project; I learned to about `malloc`, `free`, and `memset` the hard way while watching my windows crash and burn.  

I've since stopped using `foo-wm` because I was too lazy to implement full [EWMH](http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-latest.html) window hinting, which substantially limited the number of applications I could use within `foo-wm` without annoyance.

When I go to build my next wm I'd likely scrap `foo-wm` and take a completely different approach<sup>1</sup> to a meta-wm/DSL-based-wm altogether.

While Foo Wm may be dead, it spirit lives on in some form. The `0.1` release of [Bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm), a popular tree-based wm within the Arch community, was based around the server/client architecture that I built into `foo-wm`<sup>2</sup>.
