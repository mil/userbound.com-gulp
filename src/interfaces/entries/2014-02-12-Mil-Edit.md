Mil Edit is a small javascript markdown _list editor_ which supports basic text attibutes (**bold**, _italic_), has undo/redo capabilities, and drag-and-drop. 

After realizing that most browser-based markdown editors are document editor, and not _list_ editors, I set out to make my own browser-based markdown _list_ editor!  I decided my editor would exclusivly operate on a single markdown list and support text attributes in hackerish-style<sup>1</sup>. Here's a demo of `mil edit` embedded so you can get a feel of how it operates:

$(function() {
mil_edit.initialize();
//mil_edit.load_markdown([
//"- **Mil Edit** does things like:",
//"  * Indentation and Undentation",
//"  * **Bold** and _Italic_",
//"  * Undo and redo",
//"- Also: it supports _drag and drop_!",
//"  * **But** it's a little _buggy_",
//"  * :9"
//].join("\n"));
});
</script>

The [first version]() of `mil-edit` I implemented as a very simple 500-some-line [javascript singleton](https://github.com/mil/mil-edit/blob/master/js/mil_edit.js) which featured simple importing and exporting of a single markdown list using its `load` and `dump` functions.  However, I quickly became un-satisfied with the unmaintaininable and monolithic architecure of `mil edit`.

As such, I set out to make `mil edit 2`. The driving force behind it's development was a cleaner internal architecture.  I seperated out functionality into [small modules](), wrote my own [markdown library](https://github.com/mil/mil-edit-2/blob/master/js/app/mil_markdown.js)<sup>1</sup>, and [cleaned up]() the source a lot. Additionally, I added undo/redo and drag-and-drop capabilities to the feature set.

</div>


Unfortunatly, regardless of the modularity I worked into `mil edit 2`; my architecture was flawed. I wrote [tests]() _after_ the fact<sup>1</sup> and eventually the my startup failed<sup>2</sup> which was powering the development of `mil edit`, I stopped working on the project all together.

If I were to continue on `mil edit` nowawadays, I would like to re-implement, start from scratch, writing [browserify]() modules and embrace TDD from day one. Oh yeah, I'd put focus on mobile-first.

<ol class='footnotes'>
<li>In `mil edit`, you edit one line at a time. The line your editing shows markdown attributes like, \*\*star bolding\*\* \_\_underline italicizing\_\_ and converts it styled after you navigate to a different line.</li>
<li>My markdown library, dubbed mil-markdown, cut dependencies on 2 markdown libraries from the original `mil edit`, by soley handling the import and exporting of a single markdown list.</li> 
<li>This a painful mistake, and in application development one I had to learn the hard way.</li>
<li>Ask me to show you a demo of my failed startup which wraps [Mmvp.js]() and my [Mil Edit 2]() abondware!</li>
