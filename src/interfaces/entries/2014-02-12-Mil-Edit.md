## Overview
Mil Edit is a small javascript markdown list editor I originally made to be used in conjunction with [Markdown Tree](). While in college at Virginia Tech, I took [all my notes]() as plain text markdown.

## mil-edit 1
There are a million and a half markdown editors out there. Most of them try to do too much. I set out to make a markdown editor that supported a subset of markdown:

- Edits a single list, with unlimited nesting
- Supports **bold**, _italics_, and [links]()
- Exports and imports to markdown

And `mil-edit` was born. It was one of my first major javascript application projects, and architecturally it was a bit naive. I implemented it as a 500-some-line javascript [singleton](https://github.com/mil/mil-edit/blob/master/js/mil_edit.js).

## mil-edit 2
Mil edit 2 was my attempt to rebuild mil-edit from the ground up. The major thing I wanted to focus on was making my code more modular. Intsead of constructing one singleton.

I made small de-coupled modules based around extending using `_.extend` to augment the object. For example, [keybindings](https://github.com/mil/mil-edit-2/blob/master/js/app/keybindings.js), [undo/redo stack](https://github.com/mil/mil-edit-2/blob/master/js/app/history.js).

## Lessons learned
Alas, I do not anylonger maintain `mil-edit`, or `mil-edit 2`.

My development approach toward `mil-edit 2` was also a bit faulted in that I wrote my test a posteriori.
