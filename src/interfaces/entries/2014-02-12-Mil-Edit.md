Mil Edit is a small javascript markdown _list editor_ which supports basic text attibutes (**bold**, _italic_), has undo/redo capabilities, and drag-and-drop. 

I made `mil edit` after realizing that most browser-based markdown editors are document; and not _list_ editors. 

In contrarian style, I set out to make a _list_ editor! I decided my editor would operate on a single markdown list do text attributes in hackerish-style<sup>1</sup> Here's a demo of `mil edit` embedded so you can get a feel of how it operates:

$(function() {
mil_edit.initialize();
mil_edit.load_markdown([
"- **Mil Edit** does things like:",
"  * Indentation and Undentation",
"  * **Bold** and _Italic_",
"  * Undo and redo",
"- Also: it supports _drag and drop_!",
"  * **But** it's a little _buggy_",
"  * :9"
].join("\n"));
});
</script>

The [first version]() I released of `mil-edit` was implemented as a very simple 500-some-line [javascript singleton](https://github.com/mil/mil-edit/blob/master/js/mil_edit.js) which featured simple importing and exporting of a single markdown list using the `load` and `dump` functions.  

<p>Un-satisfied with the unmaintaininable and monolithic architecure of `mil edit`, I set out to make `mil edit 2`. The driving force behind it's development was a cleaner internal architecture.  I seperated out functionality into [small modules](), wrote my own [markdown library](https://github.com/mil/mil-edit-2/blob/master/js/app/mil_markdown.js)<sup>1</sup>, and cleaned up the source a lot. Additionally, I added undo/redo capabilities and drag and drop to the feature set.</p>

Unfortunatly, regardless of the modularity I implemented in `mil edit 2`; by architecture was flawed. I wrote [tests]() after the fact<sup>1</sup>. Furthermore, eventually after my startup failed<sup>2</sup>, I stopped working on `mil edit 2`. If I were to re-implement today, I'd probably start from scratch, writing [browserify]() modules and embrace TDD. Oh yeah, and focus on mobile-first.

<ol class='footnotes'>
<li>In `mil edit`, you edit one line at a time. The line your editing shows markdown attributes like, \*\*star bolding\*\* \_\_underline italicizing\_\_ and converts it styled after you navigate to a different line.</li>
<li>My markdown library, dubbed mil-markdown, cut dependencies on 2 markdown libraries from the original `mil edit`, by soley handling the import and exporting of a single markdown list.</li> 
<li>This a painful mistake, and in application development one I had to learn the hard way.</li>
<li>Ask me to show you a demo of my failed startup which wraps [Mmvp.js]() and my [Mil Edit 2]() abondware!</li>
