There's a sketch of me in the upper left.  I use this site to host my [works](/works), [interfaces](/interfaces), and [blog posts](/blog).</p>

    <p>My own homebuilt [window manager](/interfaces/Foo-Wm), a recent [mixtape](/works/mixtapes) of numerous short musical compositions, and my [micro-MVP framework](/interfaces/Mmvp.js/) are the projects available for viewing on this site that I am currently the most proud of.</p>
