I thought it would be awesome if you could hand someone a physical Bitcoin note. So I designed the Bitcoin Note.

The design includes place for public key and value and is mainly just for prop value.  Unfortunatly, I've lost the original file I designed the note in. It was a nice big Gimp file. Below is the design of the front and back.
