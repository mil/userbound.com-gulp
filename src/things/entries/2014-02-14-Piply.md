[Piply](https://github.com/mil/Piply) is a small `python2`, `alsa`, and `mplayer`-based audio playing interface for the Raspberry Pi and [pi plate](http://www.adafruit.com/product/1109) I created after failing to find a good mplayer wrapper interface to the pi plate.

Piply includes a small file-browsing interface, a playback screen in which you can speed up or slow down a song, and a configuration screen to adjust volume.

The user interface contains 3 screens:
- **Now**: shows the currently playing song
- **Lib**: a simple filebrowsing interface
- **Cfg**: volume control

I really love using the Raspberry Pi hooked up to my audio drive. Right now I run Arch Linux ARM on my Pi, and from boot all I have to do is `ssh` in and start `python2 Piply.py` to get it up and running (under a `dtach` session). 

I plan to eventually write a small systemd script to automate the process all together to have an end-to-end audio player.
