One weekend while hacking away on my Thinkpad X40, I began to grow irritated by the lettering on my keys. I decided that I wanted blank keys on my Thinkpad ala a [Das keyboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Keyboard) or something of the sort. I search online briefly for places to buy blank keys, then decided to just start experimenting with blanking the keys myself.

The process I found to work to produce good consistent blank keys is made up of two steps. First, each key is removed from the keyboard and sanded with dull-grit sandpaper. Then a small amount of mineral oil is dabbed atop each key and spread to hide the sanding roughness.

    <span class='caption'>Only a small amount of mineral oil is needed for each key. I suggest [Wegman](http://www.wegmans.com/)'s brand for best results..</span>

When looking at the keyboard with fully blanked keys, you can tell it's non-stock, but it actually looks surprisingly professional. I found that it was best to smooth the hard edges on each key, making each key more smooth than concave. This plays better with the polishing as well.
