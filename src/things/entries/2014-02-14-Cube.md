During the summer of my junior year at Virginia Tech, I stayed in Blacksburg and did the summer-session for Industrial Design minors. It was one of the most relaxing, thoughtful, and productive summers of my life. I learned to sketch perspective and developed an interest in [Openscad]().

For our final project in the summer-session, I built a small portable speaker box I named the Cube.

In terms of actually producing the speaker, since the design was all pretty much flat, at the suggestion of my professor I built the entire thing out of [masonite](). In tandem with my sketching, I modeled the Cube in [Openscad](), laying out each piece as a 2d-solid that could be exported to `dxf` files. The individual dxf file's I assembled using Openscad's `import` command, digitally assembling how I would eventually assemble the Cube. Eventually when I was satisfied with my digitally modeled Cube, I dumped all my `dxf` files into a master `dxf`, put on some goggles, and took a trip to the lasercam.

The only piece that I didn't cut out of masonite was the front grill area. Since it would be too thick, I instead opted for a thin plywood that I also laser cam'd watching the laser drop holes into the sheet of plywood was quite awesome.
