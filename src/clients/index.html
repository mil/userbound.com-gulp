  <div class='filter-el visible' data-category-ibm>
    <p>I've been working with IBM's Design studio in Austin, Texas since mid-2014 to assist in development of the <a href="http://ibm.com/design/language">IBM Design Language</a> site. The team that I worked alongside to get the site launched included a myriad of visual designers, user-experience designeres, and several other front-end developers<sup>1</sup>.</p>
    <p>My development contributions to the site include pagebuilds within the [framework](http://www.ibm.com/design/language/framework.shtml) section, an [interactive color wheel](http://www.ibm.com/design/language/framework/visual/color.shtml), and the the tile-esque [inspiration](http://www.ibm.com/design/language/inspiration.shtml) section of the site.</p>

  <div class='filter-el' data-category-atomic-axis>
    <p>In early 2014, I was sub-contracted by [Atomic Axis](http://atomicaxis.com) to develop the site for [Happy Mukti](http://mukti.userbound.com), an organic food devliery startup. 

    <p>I was responsible for entire site's development from ground up. The site was built on top of Wordpress<sup>1</sup>. The site features eCommerce functionality and is fully responsive.<p>

  <div class='filter-el' data-category-senetek-plc>
    <p>In 2013, I created a site for [Senetek PLC](http://www.senetekplc.com/), a publicly traded mining company. The stakeholder wanted a simple and straightforward site outlining their [projects](http://www.senetekplc.com/projects), [SEC Filings](http://www.senetekplc.com/investors/sec-filings), and [corporate information](http://www.senetekplc.com/corporate).</p>

    <p>I was responsible for everything on the site from the design to the development. The site featured a live stock ticker that updates with the company's stock price and a live feed of their corporate news.</p>
