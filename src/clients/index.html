    <p>I started working with IBM's Design studio in Austin in 2014.  Most of my work at IBM has been centered around the <a href="http://ibm.com/design/language">IBM Design Language</a> site, which serves as a sort of normative guide<sup>1</sup> for designing IBM products. Design patterns and best practices are mentioned but the site is far from an explicit style guide.</p>

    <p>My contribution on the site was largely in the department of front-end development and some interaction design. My work was primarily within the [framework]() section of the site.</p>

    <p>I also collaborated with one of our talented visual designers on the project and [coded up]() the color wheel on the site and the [Inspiration]() section of the site.<sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>I've worked for Atomic Axis as a part-time consultant for the site build of the <a href="http://mukti.userbound.com">Happy Mukti</a> site.  I worked based on provided high-fidelity comps to create a fully-integrated Wordpress site. I developed two Wordpress plugins in the proccess.
