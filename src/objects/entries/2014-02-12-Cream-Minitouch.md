The SIIG MiniTouch is a 75% mechnical keyboard produced circa 1991. At the time of manufacture, the MiniTouch was outfitted with either [clicky white](http://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCM_White) or [montery blue ](http://deskthority.net/wiki/SMK_Alps_mount) alp switches.  Admiring the form factor and mechanical nature of the Minitouch, I decided to pick one up for $30-some bills on eBay.  My problem with the Minitouch was that it was an order of magnitude louder than any keyboard I'd ever owned.

To rectify the Minitouch's noise problem, I swapped in modded un-damped lowered-resistance cream ALPS switches.  I extracted [cream alps switches](http://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_WKCM_Cream_Damped) from an Apple Extended II keyboard. After I de-soldered and [dissambled each switch](http://sdjfoi.com a Good description of how to dissamble Alps switches) from the Apple Extended II, I cut each switches' tightly curled springs end. I removed the black dampeners from each contact top side. Finally I re-assmbled each switch.

After the switchm modding was complete, I de-soldered all the switches from my Minitouch and soldered in my new modded cream switches.  Re-assmbled, I swapped on the PBT keycaps from the Apple Extended 2 keyboard. Not all the keycaps from the Apple Extended II keyboard fit, so I kept the original Enter, Shift, Spacebar, and tab keys. The Apple F-keys fit on the Minitouch sideways because of the differences in casing design.

Overall I love the results of my modded Minitouch. It has a super light touch, my fingers fly on it. Other than getting some better feeling PBT keycaps for the missing keys - its !
